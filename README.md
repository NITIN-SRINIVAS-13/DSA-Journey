# DSA‑Journey 🧠

A structured, C++‑based repository containing well‑organized solutions to classic and advanced Data Structures & Algorithms problems.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repo is your gateway to mastering algorithmic problem solving.  
It’s structured by topic and includes detailed explanations and references.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Patterns & Miscellaneous

---

## 🧪 How to Navigate

Each folder in the root corresponds to a topic—e.g. `Arrays/`, `Dyanmic Programming/`.  
Inside, each file or folder contains:
- Problem description (LeetCode or similar)
- C++ solution file (typically `.cpp`)
- Markdown explanation with your logic, complexities, and edge-case handling


---

## 🧰 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<nitttinnnnnn>/DSA‑Journey.git
    ```
2. Navigate to any topic folder to explore problems and code.
3. Compile and run your C++ code with:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
    ```

## 📊 Repo Stats

- 🔁 Regular commits (updated often)
- ✅ Clear focus on one problem per file  
- 🧠 Explanations paired with code for deeper understanding  
- 🌱 Ideal for interview prep or learning pace-by-pace

---

## 💡 Why It Stands Out

- **Clean structure**: Makes it easy to find topic-wise solutions  
- **Learning Orientation**: Accompanying explanations help reinforce concepts  
- **Beginner-friendly**: Good stepping stone before building project-based algorithms
